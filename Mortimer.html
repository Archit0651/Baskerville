			<h1><center><font face="Algerian" color="Red"><em><u><b>Mortimer</b></u></em></font></center></h1>
Family friend and doctor to the Baskervilles. Mortimer is a tall, thin man who dresses sloppily but is an all-around nice guy and the executor of Charles's estate. Mortimer is also a phrenology enthusiast, and he wishes and hopes to some day have the opportunity to study Holmes' head.
